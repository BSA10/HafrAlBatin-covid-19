# **Hafar Albatin Covid-19 Dashboard**

I make a simple dashboard for Hafar Albatin Governorates<br>
to track the covid-19 about cases.I used Moh.gov.sa statics<br>
to grab all the data.

## How to run
I made my own database for grabing the datas and save it.
So you have to make sure that you make the databse.
```
git clone https://github.com/BSA10/HafrAlBatin-covid-19.git
cd HafrAlbatin-covid-19
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## TODO:

- [ ] Make a latest corona case by the date and make loop on ModelAttribute for that so that can show as th:each on the day case by the city on hafar albatin governorate.         
- [ ] Update the Cases at specific time.
- [ ] Deploy the project.
